# The Game

- A C++ Windows console game I created around 2016 while learning the basics of C++. 
- The main idea of "The Game" is not unique, but it was a fun little project to work with.

## Idea of "The Game"

The player must navigate through a labyrinth, filling out every empty tile (player can step on a single tile once), and end up on the specified tile.
