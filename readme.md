# The Game

- C++ console window game which I created around 2016 while learning basics of C++. The main idea of "The Game" is not unique, but it what was a fun little project to work with, while diving into basics of programming.
- Keep in mind that the code was written in the early stages of my programming life, meaning that this code is awful from a perspective of experienced and efficient developer. So I would suggest focusing on the idea itself and enjoy those 5 minutes of wandering around it.
- Idea of "The Game": player must walk through labyrinth, filling out every empty tile, end up on specified tile.
- I wrote this code on Windows and I used `conio.h` header file, which is used mostly by MS-DOS compilers to provide console input/output and is not included in a C standard library. This means, that this program will probably compile only on Windows.
